# Avalon tokens

## Features and design goals

- Best practices: Smart contracts are written with the latest best practices of Ethereum community
- Separation of concerns: Token minting and crowdsale lie in separate contracts and are managed by different companies that are assembled together
- Testable: We aim for 100% branch code coverage by automated test suite
- Auditable: Our tool chain supports verifiable EtherScan.io contract builds
- No inflation: The capped limit of 10M chips is hardcoded in the contract. This limit can never be crossed
- Build upon a foundation: Instead of building everything from scratch, OpenZeppelin contracts are used as much as possible as they are the gold standard of Solidity development

## Security
Avalon undertakes to provide secure, tested and community-audited code.

If you find a security issue, please email [security@avalon.nu](mailto:security@avalon.nu)

## Contract source verified

Smart contract is available on Etherscan to be auditable.
